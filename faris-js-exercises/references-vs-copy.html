    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const slicedTeam = players.slice();
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newTeam = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99});
    const newestPerson = {...person};
    console.log(newPerson);
    console.log(person);
    console.log(newestPerson);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
